- Sets up instant continuous deployment on `git push`
- Realtime backend logs and API request monitoring

### Cyclic Runtime

- Cyclic hosts your app on serverless infrastructure. That means there is no guarantee of memory or file system persistence between requests.
- The runtime expects a nodejs entry point defined as:
  - package.json "main" field defines the entry point file (if missing uses index.js)
  - Entry point starts a server on `process.env.PORT`
